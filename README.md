Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Ans: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. it involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
Important of software engineerin enable us to creat software application and systems that power various aspect of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Ans: The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s, the advent of structure programming in the 1970s and the the establishment of software programming as a dicipline in the 1960s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Ans: Requirement, Design, Implementation, Testing, deployment and Maintenance.
Requirement: Gathering and documenting the users needs and system requirement prior to the development of the software.
Design: The detailed design of the software are architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design.
Testing: Testing the code to make sure it meet the user requirement.
Deployment: Releasing the software to the users. 
Maintenance: continous maintenance of the software to check for bugs and probably updates of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Ans: Waterfall Method is more or less like a static method of software development, no room for any flexibility while Agile method is flexible and give rooms for changes during software development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Ans: 
A software developers focuse on writing programming code.
Quality Assurance Engineer design and excute test plans
Project manager: Monitor the planning, excution and delivery of the software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANS: IDEs are tools for writing, testing and debugging codes (eg: VScode Atom, Anaconda, Bracket)
VCS are use to track changes on source code.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Ans:
1. Changing requirement
2. Tight deadline
3. Technical debt
To overcome these challenges:
Effective communication 
Agile methodology
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Ans:
Unit: testing individual components or modules of software
Integration: Testing interaction between different components or subsystems.
System: TEsting the entire software system
Acceptance: Testing against user requirement to ensure it meet users needs.
Importants: This is the most importants aspect in QA.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting a very suitable and concise question for AI to be able to give a concise response back to the users.
Prompt engineering is just like giving a concise and step by step of how to make a cake.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Chat GPT: Define AI prompt engineering.
Define AI prompt engineering for a 5 years old boy and a African, make it as simple as possible for better understanding.

The improved prompt is important because the AI needs to understande what the users is asking it to do, fot it to be able to give a better answer.
